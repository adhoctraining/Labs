## Lab: Network Traffic Analysis Lab

Step-by-Step Network Traffic Analysis Lab

Objective: The objective of this lab is to introduce students to network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer.

Prerequisites:

    Basic understanding of networking concepts.
    Installation of Wireshark on student computers or a dedicated lab machine.
    Access to a network environment with network traffic to analyze (e.g., virtualized network, simulated network traffic).

Materials:

    Computers with Wireshark installed.
    Virtualized network environment or network traffic generator for analysis.

Steps:

Step 1: Setting Up the Lab Environment

    Ensure that Wireshark is installed on student computers or a dedicated lab machine.
    Set up a network environment with network traffic to analyze, such as a virtualized network or simulated network traffic.

Step 2: Capturing Network Traffic

    Instruct students to launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for capturing traffic.
    Start capturing network traffic by clicking on the "Start" button in Wireshark.

Step 3: Analyzing Captured Traffic

    Have students analyze captured network traffic using Wireshark's filtering and analysis features.
    Demonstrate how to filter traffic based on protocols, source/destination IP addresses, ports, and other criteria.
    Discuss common network protocols and their characteristics (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP) observed in the captured traffic.

Step 4: Identifying Network Anomalies

    Guide students in identifying network anomalies or suspicious activity in the captured traffic.
    Highlight indicators of potential security threats such as unusual traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or suspicious communication.

Step 5: Protocol Analysis

    Encourage students to perform protocol analysis on specific network protocols observed in the captured traffic.
    Discuss the structure and behavior of common network protocols, including packet headers, message formats, and typical communication patterns.

Step 6: Extracting Metadata and Artifacts

    Instruct students to extract metadata and artifacts from the captured network traffic, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, timestamps, and payload data.
    Discuss the significance of extracted metadata in network traffic analysis and security investigations.

Step 7: Investigating Security Incidents

    Present students with scenario-based security incidents or network anomalies to investigate using Wireshark.
    Guide students through the process of analyzing captured traffic to identify the root cause of security incidents and formulate appropriate response actions.

Step 8: Generating Reports

    Task students with generating reports summarizing their network traffic analysis findings.
    Encourage students to include insights, observations, and recommendations for improving network security based on their analysis.

Step 9: Reviewing and Refining

    Conduct a post-lab discussion to review students' findings, insights, and experiences during the network traffic analysis exercise.
    Facilitate a discussion on best practices, challenges, and lessons learned in network traffic analysis using Wireshark.

Conclusion: In this lab, students gained hands-on experience in network traffic analysis using Wireshark, from capturing and filtering network traffic to identifying network anomalies and investigating security incidents. By following these steps, students developed essential skills in network protocol analysis and security monitoring.
