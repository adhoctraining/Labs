How I cleared my CEH Practihttps://xiotz.com/ceh-practical-exam-my-first-try-victory/

Hello Hackers! In this blog I will be sharing my secret strategy on how I cleared my CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) Practical exam in the first attempt. In the next 10 minutes, you will have a whole roadmap in front of you on what is CEH (Practical), who can take this exam and what are the things required to clear this exam along with my strategy.
Let’s start

The Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical) exam is a tough test that lasts for six hours. During this exam, you need to show how you can use ethical hacking methods to solve security problems within a limited time, just like in real situations. A group of experts, including people with a lot of experience, created this exam. They made 20 situations based on real life and asked questions about them. These questions check if you have the important skills needed for ethical hacking, like the ones you learn in the C|EH program. This exam isn’t a pretend one – it’s like a real company’s computer network. They use virtual machines, networks, and programs that work live to test your ethical hacking skills.

How to enroll for CEH Practical ?

    Go to EC-Council official website and read through everything you need to know https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh-practical/
    Create Account: Create an account on EC-Council’s Aspen portal.
    Purchase Voucher: Buy a CEH Practical exam voucher from EC-Council or authorized centers. You can either buy the voucher from official store i.e. https://store.eccouncil.org/product/ceh-practical-exam/    
    Or you can fill the form from official website and you will get the whole guide via call or text (I personally prefer this way as you can ask your doubts and they help us understand)
    Schedule Exam: Log in to Aspen, select an exam date, and schedule the exam.

Exam Experience:

I know this is the most awaited part. The exam is watched over by a person called a proctor. They use GoToMeeting, a program that sees and hears you through your computer. They’ll also record what’s on your screen during the whole exam. After your identity is verified, your exam starts.

The exam is on a website called iLab. You don’t need to worry about taking pictures of your virtual machines (VMs).

You’ll get two Operating systems to test things on. One is Parrot OS, and the other is Windows 7. No more Kali this time.

You can DO use the internet for the exam. You can look things up, take notes on your computer, watch videos, and read blogs.

But DON”T write notes by hand, talk to people, or make calls.

Your exam computers won’t have regular internet access. You need to use your web browser to access the internet.

    Start with the scanning part (NMAP Scan), since the scanning part takes some time, I moved on to other hacking questions.

    Scan all ports on IPs because default scripts might not catch smart configurations.

    Use custom word lists for each module. For brute-forcing, try “Hydra & Medusa.”

    Practice hacking on an Android-based Hack The Box (HTB) box, as the coursework covers mobile hacking.
    If a challenge is too hard or time-consuming, move on and return later.

    Don’t skip cryptography and steganography modules. Learn the basics.

    Reconnaissance and enumeration are crucial. Gather lots of details.

    Submit answers exactly as requested; prepopulated answers matter.
    Google is helpful, but avoid prying into personal matters!

Study Guide 

This is the main picture. I know you guys are excited about this. In my case, I had prior knowledge of basic linux OS and some tools but don’t worry about it. This exam portion starts from basic and trains you till your potential to clear this exam.

If you got money, you can afford iLabs because the challenges are based on the iLab environment and you will get hands-on practice to clear this exam.

If you can’t afford iLab, there are many platforms in which you can practice the listed tools. I personally prefer TryHackMe and HackTheBox. This Exam is all about how much knowledge you have on tools.

Resources
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)

DVWA is a PHP/MYSQL vulnerable website that’s made to be easy to hack. It’s used to practice common web problems. It has different levels of difficulty. DVWA is important for the CEH (Practical) exam. It’s a good idea to practice on DVWA because the exam might have similar challenges. 

You can refer to the link https://bughacking.com/dvwa-ultimate-guide-first-steps-and-walkthrough/ for full guide on setup and use of DVWA.
