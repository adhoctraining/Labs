Objective: The objective of this lab is to introduce students to Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) concepts using Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform.

Prerequisites:

    Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
    Familiarity with virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox).
    Installation of Wazuh on a virtual machine or dedicated server.

Materials:

    Virtual machine or dedicated server with Wazuh installed.
    Access to simulated security events or network traffic for monitoring and analysis.

Steps:

Step 1: Introduction to EDR/XDR

    Provide an overview of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) concepts.
    Explain the importance of EDR/XDR solutions in detecting and responding to security threats across endpoints and networks.

Step 2: Installing Wazuh

    Install and configure Wazuh on a virtual machine or dedicated server.
    Ensure that Wazuh agents are deployed on endpoint devices for continuous monitoring.

Step 3: Configuring Wazuh Rules

    Explore Wazuh rules and configuration options for detecting security events and anomalies.
    Customize Wazuh rulesets based on specific security requirements and threat intelligence feeds.

Step 4: Monitoring Endpoint Activity

    Use Wazuh to monitor endpoint activity in real-time, including process execution, file system changes, and network connections.
    Demonstrate how to view and analyze endpoint logs and security events reported by Wazuh agents.

Step 5: Detecting Malicious Activity

    Simulate security events or attacks on endpoint devices to trigger Wazuh alerts.
    Monitor Wazuh alerts and notifications for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and potential security incidents.

Step 6: Investigating Security Incidents

    Investigate security incidents reported by Wazuh to determine the scope and impact of the attack.
    Use Wazuh to gather additional context and forensic evidence for incident response and remediation.

Step 7: Responding to Security Incidents

    Discuss incident response procedures and best practices for containing and mitigating security incidents.
    Demonstrate how to take responsive actions using Wazuh, such as quarantining compromised endpoints or blocking malicious IP addresses.

Step 8: Analyzing Security Trends

    Analyze security trends and patterns observed in Wazuh alerts and logs.
    Discuss the significance of security trends in identifying emerging threats and refining security strategies.

Step 9: Integration with SIEM and Threat Intelligence

    Integrate Wazuh with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized log management and correlation.
    Discuss the benefits of integrating Wazuh with threat intelligence feeds for enhanced threat detection and response capabilities.

Step 10: Reviewing and Refining

    Conduct a post-lab discussion to review students' experiences and observations during the EDR/XDR lab with Wazuh.
    Facilitate a discussion on the importance of EDR/XDR solutions in modern cybersecurity operations and strategies for optimizing Wazuh deployment and configuration.

Conclusion: In this lab, students gained practical experience in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) concepts using Wazuh for security monitoring and incident response. By following these steps, students developed essential skills in leveraging Wazuh to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats across endpoints and networks.
