Lab: PCAP Analysis with Zeek

PCAP Analysis with Zeek

Objective: The objective of this lab is to introduce participants to PCAP analysis using Zeek (formerly known as Bro), an open-source network security monitoring tool. Participants will learn how to analyze network traffic and extract valuable insights from PCAP files using Zeek.

Prerequisites:

    Basic understanding of networking concepts.
    Access to a computer or virtual machine with Zeek installed.
    Sample PCAP files for analysis.

Materials:

    Computer or virtual machine with Zeek installed.
    Sample PCAP files for analysis.

Steps:

Step 1: Introduction to Zeek

    Provide an overview of Zeek, its capabilities, and its role in network security monitoring.
    Explain the importance of PCAP analysis for detecting and investigating network security incidents.

Step 2: Installing Zeek

    Ensure Zeek is installed and configured on the participant's computer or virtual machine.
    Verify Zeek installation and functionality.

Step 3: Analyzing PCAP Files

    Use the zeek command to analyze a sample PCAP file.
    Review the generated Zeek logs and outputs, including conn.log, dns.log, http.log, etc.

Step 4: Extracting Insights

    Explore the Zeek logs to extract insights from the analyzed PCAP file.
    Identify network connections, DNS queries, HTTP requests, and other network activities.

Step 5: Understanding Zeek Scripts

    Introduce participants to Zeek scripts and their role in customizing analysis.
    Discuss common Zeek scripts used for specific analysis tasks (e.g., detecting malware, identifying suspicious traffic).

Step 6: Customizing Analysis with Zeek Scripts

    Modify existing Zeek scripts or create new ones to perform custom analysis on the sample PCAP file.
    Execute the modified or custom Zeek scripts and review the results.

Step 7: Analyzing Security Events

    Use Zeek to identify potential security events such as network scans, DNS tunneling, or anomalous traffic patterns.
    Investigate security events in detail and extract relevant information for further analysis.

Step 8: Generating Reports

    Generate reports from Zeek logs to document analysis findings and security events.
    Customize report formats and contents as needed for different stakeholders.

Step 9: Review and Discussion

    Facilitate a discussion on the insights gained from PCAP analysis using Zeek.
    Discuss the significance of Zeek in network security monitoring and incident response.

Conclusion: In this lab, participants were introduced to PCAP analysis using Zeek, an open-source network security monitoring tool. By following these steps, participants gained hands-on experience with analyzing network traffic, extracting insights, and identifying security events using Zeek's capabilities and customization options.
