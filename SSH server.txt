## Lab: SSH server

Creating a lab to teach about SSH servers and the protocol while focusing on foundational knowledge can be a valuable learning experience for students. Here's how you could design such a lab:

Objective: The objective of the lab is to introduce students to SSH (Secure Shell) servers, the SSH protocol, and basic SSH operations.

Materials Needed:

    Virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware.
    Linux virtual machines (VMs) for both the SSH server and client.
    SSH server software (e.g., OpenSSH) installed on one of the Linux VMs.
    SSH client software (e.g., OpenSSH client) installed on all Linux VMs.
    Network connectivity between the SSH server and client VMs.

Lab Setup:

    Set Up SSH Server: Create a Linux VM and install SSH server software (e.g., OpenSSH) on it. Configure SSH server settings such as port number, authentication methods (e.g., password-based or key-based authentication), and user accounts.

    Set Up SSH Client: Create one or more additional Linux VMs to act as SSH clients. Install SSH client software (e.g., OpenSSH client) on these VMs.

    Network Configuration: Ensure that all VMs have network connectivity to communicate with each other. You can set up a virtual network within the virtualization software to connect the SSH server and client VMs.

Lab Activities:

    Connect to SSH Server: Have students use the SSH client software to connect to the SSH server VM using both password-based and key-based authentication methods. They should practice connecting to the server using different user accounts.

    Basic SSH Operations: Once connected to the SSH server, students can perform basic operations such as:
        Listing files and directories (ls, ls -l, ls -a).
        Navigating the file system (cd, pwd).
        Creating, editing, and deleting files (touch, nano, vi, rm).
        Transferring files between the client and server using SCP (Secure Copy).

    File Transfer with SCP: Demonstrate how to transfer files securely between the SSH client and server using SCP. Students can practice transferring files of different types and sizes.

    Security Configuration: Discuss security best practices for SSH servers, such as disabling root login, enforcing strong passwords, and using key-based authentication. Have students configure the SSH server to implement these security measures.

    Troubleshooting: Introduce common SSH issues and how to troubleshoot them. Students can practice diagnosing and resolving connectivity issues, authentication failures, and configuration errors.

Assessment: Assess students' understanding of SSH servers and the protocol through a combination of:

    Observation of lab performance.
    Completion of lab tasks and exercises.
    Quizzes or written assessments covering SSH concepts, commands, and security considerations.

Conclusion: By completing this lab, students should have gained foundational knowledge of SSH servers, the SSH protocol, and basic SSH operations. They should understand how to connect to SSH servers securely, perform common file operations, transfer files using SCP, and implement security measures to protect SSH access. This hands-on experience will prepare them for more advanced topics in network security and administration.
